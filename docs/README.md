# Somewhere to keep things

## How we got here
Welcome to my page focused on networking and cloud infrastructure, 
with some other stuff that I wanted to keep. 
After migrating from an old Wordpress blog platform to Docusaurus and S3, 
I've preserved some of my most useful technical articles while continuing 
to share new insights about networking, cloud architecture, and 
infrastructure automation.

## Heritage Articles
This was imported from my old Wordpress blog.

* [Dead DHCP](heritage/dead-dhcp.md)
* [Python Route Summarisation](heritage/python-route-summarisation.md)

## Medium Articles
There are some more over at [medium.com](https://medium.simonpainter.com)
* [Anycast with Azure Route Server](medium/anycast-route-server.md)
* [Egress Security](medium/egress-security.md)
* [Intentional Alerting](medium/intentional-alerting.md)
* [The Hype around vWAN](medium/vwan-hype.md)
* [Fixing the network blame game](medium/network-blame-game.md)
* [Private Link Services](medium/private-link-services.md)
* [SDWAN as a step toward ZTNA](medium/sdwan-strategic-step-to-ztna.md)

## Repositories
* [Using pcaps to measure ttfb](https://github.com/simonpainter/capture_latency)
> I wanted to test the latency impact of several different FQDN filter methods so I came up with this to measure time to first usable byte (ttfb) which measures the TCP and SSL handshake times through L7 firewalls.
* [MoodBadger](https://github.com/simonpainter/MoodBadger)
> I saw the Badger2040 e-paper board and created this for my son to help him communciate his feelings as he's about as good at that as I am. 
* [Chatbot](https://github.com/simonpainter/chatbot)
> This emerged out of a friendly bit of banter with my neighbour via LinkedIn.
