## How we got here
Welcome to my page focused on networking and cloud infrastructure, 
with some other stuff that I wanted to keep. 
After migrating from an old Wordpress blog platform to Docusaurus and S3, 
I've preserved some of my most useful technical articles while continuing 
to share new insights about networking, cloud architecture, and 
infrastructure automation.

## Repositories
* [Using pcaps to measure ttfb](https://github.com/simonpainter/capture_latency)
> I wanted to test the latency impact of several different FQDN filter methods so I came up with this to measure time to first usable byte (ttfb) which measures the TCP and SSL handshake times through L7 firewalls.
* [MoodBadger](https://github.com/simonpainter/MoodBadger)
> I saw the Badger2040 e-paper board and created this for my son to help him communciate his feelings as he's about as good at that as I am. 
* [Chatbot](https://github.com/simonpainter/chatbot)
> This emerged out of a friendly bit of banter with my neighbour via LinkedIn.
